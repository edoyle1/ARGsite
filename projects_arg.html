                    <h3> MYNDR </h3>
                    <p>MYNDR is an iPhone app designed to help keep dementia patients independent for longer as well as lessening burden on the caregiver. Through the *redesign* of MYNDR, we have tried to incorporate as many good practices in designing for older adults as possible given the limitation of iPhone size.  We have also incorporated knowledge about how dementia patients function. </p>

                    <h3> Oxygen Bottle on Walker </h3>
                    <p>A non-trivial portion of people who use oxygen also use walkers.  However, when an oxygen bottle is placed in a walker basket, a number of problems ensue.  The basket is filled, leaving no room for other objects to be carried.  An even more significant problem is the decrease in stability due to the bottle - the walker is much more likely to tip over if even slightly lifted because of the concentrated weight high in the front.  We are developing a method for carrying both traditional oxygen cylinders as well as the newer and more common Helio systems.</p>

                    <p>We have come across a surprising number of interesting design constraints while working on this project.  First, the users still need visibility in the area of the front wheels so that they do not run into or trip over things.  The walker cannot veer toward one side or the other as a result of our solution.  If possible, the walker should be collapsable with the carrier still attached.  Finally, if possible, the user should be able to adjust the oxygen flow while standing upright using the walker for support.</p>

                    <h3> Walker Tray </h3>
                    <p>One senior citizen from our community suffers from post polio syndrome as well as age related difficulties.  As such, she has a walker with sepcial arm attachments and a tray on it.  The tray is slightly inclined and not very deep, so items often roll off her tray during transit.  She then has to kick the items to her chair or wait until ssomeone comes to visit and can pick it up for her.  We are currently involved in designing a new tray that has sufficent depth to keep things from rolling off, slots for things like pencils and pills, and a way to carry a full glass without it tiping and spilling.   </p>
