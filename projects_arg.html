                    <p>MYNDR is a smartphone application that is the brainchild of Aaron Boxer of MYNDR, Inc.  Mr. Boxer partnered with the Aging Research Group at Olin College starting in the Spring of 2012.  The goals of MYNDR are to reduce the stress of caregivers of people with dementia as well as to help to keep those dementia patients independent for longer.  </p>

                    <h3 id="myndr"> Foo </h3>
                    <p>Foo is a smartphone application that grew out of the redesign of MYNDR. The Aging Research Group took the structure of the original MYNDR but replaced the content with information based on numerous user visits and design articles.  Foo uses the latest design practices and studies to build an educational application for older adults with little technology experience.  This smartphone app is designed to be simple and intuitive, and to help the user to keep track of appointments, to-do lists, and miscellaneous information.</p>

                    <h3 id="oxwalk"> Oxygen Bottle on Walker </h3>
                    <img src="walker_prototype.jpg" id="photo" title="Picture of Prototype of Oxygen Carrying System for a Walker"> </img>
                    <p>A non-trivial portion of people who use oxygen also use walkers.  However, when an oxygen bottle is placed in a walker basket, a number of problems ensue.  The basket is filled, leaving no room for other objects to be carried.  An even more significant problem is the decrease in stability due to the bottle - the walker is much more likely to tip over if even slightly lifted because of the concentrated weight high in the front.  We are developing a method for carrying both traditional oxygen cylinders as well as the newer and more common Helio systems.</p>

                    <p>We have come across a surprising number of interesting design constraints while working on this project.  First, the users still need visibility in the area of the front wheels so that they do not run into or trip over things.  The walker cannot veer toward one side or the other as a result of our solution.  If possible, the walker should be collapsible with the carrier still attached.  Finally, if possible, the user should be able to adjust the oxygen flow while standing upright using the walker for support.</p>

                    <h3 id="walktray"> Walker Tray </h3>
                     <img src="walker_bags.jpg" id="photo" title="Picture of Walker with Bags for Carrying Things"> </img>
                    <p>One senior citizen from our community suffers from post polio syndrome as well as age related difficulties.  As such, she has a walker with special arm attachments and a tray on it.  The tray is slightly inclined and not very deep, so items often roll off her tray during transit.  She then has to kick the items to her chair or wait until someone comes to visit and can pick it up for her.  We have designed special bags that attach on the inside of her walker to carry papers and other things that would roll or slide off of the tray.  Our next step is to develop a way for her to carry the three different kinds of glasses she uses without them tipping over in transit or the drink sloshing out.   </p>
