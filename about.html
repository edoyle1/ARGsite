                   <h3> ABOUT US </h3>
                        <p>The Aging Research Group at Olin College of Engineering is focused on designing practical well-made solutions to everyday difficulties that those over 65 are facing.  This includes big problems such as safely getting out of bed in the morning as well as the everyday annoyances such as buttoning buttons or picking up dropped papers.  The Aging Research Group employs user oriented design throughout the design process.</p>

                        <p>We are researching in the realms of mechanical design, technological design, and the intersection between the two.</p>

                        <p>Right now, we are focusing primarily on the role that technology plays in the lives of elders, where the barriers are to elders using technology, and how technology can enhance the lives of our elders.</p>

                    <h3> Empathy Exercises </h3>
                            <p>One step to learning about the difficulties due to aging and the opportunities to help is to simulate some of the physical limitations that arise due to aging.  This is done by the research group using a series of empathy exercises.  These exercises are also good in-house testing methods.  When running the exercises with elderly present, we invite them to participate too and feel some of the conditions they themselves do not have but that others (perhaps a friend or spouse) are dealing with.<br></p>

                    <p><b>Eye Conditions</b>
                        A set of lenses that simulate degenerative eye conditions such as macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, and low vision offer a new perspective on the visual difficulties of these conditions. *pic*<br></p>

                    <p><b>Movement</b>
                        Taping the knuckles of the hand helps to simulate arthritis in the hands.  Participants then try daily activities such as opening a pill bottle, tying shoes, and using scissors.<br></p>

                        <p>Similarly, wrapping knees allows participants to see the challenges of decreased leg mobility while sitting down, rising from the floor, or tying shoes.  <br><p/>

                        <p>One optional activity for our students is spending the day in a wheelchair. One of our students took on the challenge and found the navigational and building structure constraints at the college nearly impossible as a healthy and active 18 year old, something she never would have thought about otherwise.<br></p>
