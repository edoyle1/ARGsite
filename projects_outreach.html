                     <img src="img/empathy1.jpg" id="photo" align="left" title="Picture of Student Trying a Wheelchair"> </img>
                     <img src="img/empathy2.jpg" id="photo" title="Picture of Poeple Visiting the Eye Condition Simulation Table"> </img> 
                    <p>One step to learning about the difficulties due to aging and the opportunities to help is to simulate some of the physical limitations that arise as one ages.  The research group is able to learn about these difficulties by using a series of empathy exercises.  These exercises are also good in-house testing methods.  When running the exercises with older adults present, we invite them to participate too and experience some of the conditions that they themselves do not have but that others (perhaps a friend or spouse) are dealing with.<br></p><BR>

                    <p><b>Eye Conditions</b><br>
                        <img src="img/eye_conditions.jpg" id="photo" align="left"  title="Picture of Peope Using Low Vision Goggles" style="padding:0px 20px 0px 0px;"> </img>
                    A set of lenses that simulate degenerative eye conditions such as macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, and low vision offer a new perspective on the visual limitations of these conditions.<br></p><BR><BR>

                    <p><b>Movement</b><br>
                        <img src="img/movement.jpg" id="photo"  align="left" title="Picture of People Simulating Arthritis"  style="padding:0px 20px 0px 0px;"> </img>
                    Taping the knuckles of the hand helps to simulate arthritis.  Participants then try daily activities such as opening a pill bottle, tying shoes, and using scissors, and experience first-hand the difference arthritis makes.  Similarly, wrapping knees allows participants to see the challenges of decreased leg mobility while sitting down, rising from the floor, or tying shoes.<br></p><BR>

                    <p><img src="img/empathy1.jpg" id="photo" align="left" title="Picture of Student Trying a Wheelchair"  style="padding:0px 20px 0px 0px;"> </img>
                    One optional activity for our students is spending the day in a wheelchair. One of our students took on the challenge and found the navigational and building structure constraints at the college nearly impossible as a healthy and active 18 year old, something she never would have thought about otherwise.<br></p><BR>

                    <h3> North Hill OT Workshop </h3>
                    <p>We are partnering with the North Hill Fitness Department to develop a workshop to help older adults learn about commercial solutions available to help with difficulties associated with aging as well as empowering the older adults to talk among themselves and share homemade solutions and work-a-rounds.</p><BR><BR>
